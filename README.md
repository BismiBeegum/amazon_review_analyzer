## 🎯 steps for running the repository
1. run pdt_reviewCollector.py
2. if planning to use customized model change the path to saved model and perform appropriate data inference.
3. run streamlit_userInterface.py using command: streamlit run streamlit_userInterface.py
4. Login and perform analysis.

## 🤖 Model Info
The model (svm_model.sav) is trained on labeled Amazon reviews using TF-IDF + SVM. You can retrain it on your own dataset for customization. save and load it by changing pah to the model.

✨ TODOs / Improvements
 Add model retraining UI

 Export plots for sentiment
