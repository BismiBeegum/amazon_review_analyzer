It allows users to: - Search for Amazon products - Analyze review sentiments using a deep learning model - View insights like sentiment distribution - See search history and leave feedback --- ## 🚀 Features - 🔐 User authentication (signup/login) - 🛒 Scrape Amazon product details (title, image, price, reviews) - 🤖 Sentiment prediction using a trained LSTM model - 🎨 Interactive UI built with Streamlit - 💾 Session history stored locally - 🗣️ Feedback submission --- ## 🛠️ Tech Stack - **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit, Streamlit Option Menu - **Backend**: Python - **ML Model**: LSTM (trained via `model_creation.py`) - **Auth**: `streamlit-authenticator` - **Web Scraping**: Selenium - **Data Handling**: Pandas --- ## ⚙️ Setup Instructions Clone the repository: ```bash git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-review-analysis.git cd amazon-review-analysis ``` Install dependencies: ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt ``` Run the Streamlit app: ```bash streamlit run streamlit_userInterface.py ``` --- ## 📁 File Structure ```bash . ├── streamlit_userInterface.py # Main Streamlit app ├── pdt_reviewCollector.py # Amazon scraper logic ├── lstm_review_classifier.py # Logic to load model and predict ├── model_creation.py # Script to train and save LSTM model ├── model_functions.py # Prediction logic reused across app ├── tokenizer.sav # Saved tokenizer for preprocessing ├── hashed_pw.pkl # Pickled hashed passwords ├── images/ # UI assets ├── output.csv # User data ├── out.csv # Review predictions ├── outlink.csv # Product links ├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies └── README.md # Project overview ``` --- ## 🎯 Steps to Run the Project 1. Run `pdt_reviewCollector.py` to collect product reviews 2. If planning to use a **custom-trained model**, run `model_creation.py` to generate and save the LSTM model and tokenizer 3. The prediction logic uses functions from `model_functions.py` 4. Run the main app with: ```bash streamlit run streamlit_userInterface.py ``` 5. Login with your credentials and start analyzing reviews 🎉 --- ## 🤖 Model Info The model is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on labeled Amazon reviews. It uses a tokenizer saved as `tokenizer.sav` for consistent preprocessing. The model must be created using `model_creation.py`. To customize: - Modify `model_creation.py` to train on your dataset - Save the new model and tokenizer - Update the paths in `lstm_review_classifier.py` accordingly --- ## ✨ TODOs / Improvements - Add UI for training custom models - Export visualizations for sentiment results - Deploy app publicly (e.g., Streamlit Community Cloud) --- ## 📬 Feedback or Issues? Feel free to open an issue or leave feedback using the app’s **Feedback** section! ``` </pre>
